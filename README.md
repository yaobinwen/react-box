# react-box

## Overview

This repository has the notes and code of my study of React.js.

## Topics

The `topics` folder has the notes of the subjects I have studied or am studying. Here is a brief list of them. See the `README` in each folder for more details.

- `test-async-component`: This topic studies how to test a React component that has asynchronous code. Typically, this kind of component, when rendered, fetches data from the back-end server and updates its own state, which makes the component not to settle down in a stable state until several rounds of updates.

See the [`REFERENCES`](./REFERENCES.md) for the references and articles I have collected from the Internet.
