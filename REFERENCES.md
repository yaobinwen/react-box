# References

## Overview

(2019-04-16: I decided to move the references to the main `README.md` file.)

This file has the good references and articles I have collected from the Internet, as well as some notes I made after reading them.

I put the notes before the list because the notes are more important than the reference links. I can quickly recap what I have learned by skimming the notes, but not the reference links.
