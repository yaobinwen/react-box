# README

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I removed the main content of this README file because you can always find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
